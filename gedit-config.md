### Gedit Configuration for VIU CSCI

[Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) is an open source text editor.
It is simple to use, and works very well for first year computer science.

There are, however, several configuration changes that can be made to help make things easier to read, program, and mark.
